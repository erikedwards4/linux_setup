# setup

Bash scripts to setup a new Linux machine for audio, speech, ASR, NLP, ML, etc.

This includes many basic dependencies, coding languages, command-line tools, toolboxes, etc.,

I cite the software licence for higher-level tools.
This is critical information for deciding which tools to use in practical settings.

I include descriptions, references, and website links for almost all tools.
This shows where to get further information, but is also a theme of this project:
we should not just take for granted the many awesome tools provided by other developers.
Everything we do as developers stands on the shoulders of giants:

nanos gigantum humeris insidentes

This was written and tested on Ubuntu (18.04, the most recent LTS version).
It could probably be adapted easily to other Linux distros.


## Dependencies
Ubuntu (tested on Ubuntu 18.04).


## Usage
For minimal set-up of a new Linux instance for ASR, run setup_basic_ml_asr.sh.

For longer-term set-up, use each step[1-9]_*.sh in turn.
However, a few installs require some interaction (e.g. aws),
so the best (and most educational) way to run this is line-by-line.
