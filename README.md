# setup

This is a repo for my bash scripts that I use to setup a new Linux machine.
These are many command-line tools, coding languages, toolboxes, etc.,
and the dependencies (e.g. basic C/C++ libraries) thereto.

I include description, references, and website link for almost all tools.
I also include the software licence for most higher-level tools.

This is written for Ubuntu, but could probably be adapted to other distros.
This has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 (the most recent LTS version).


## Installation
None, just that Ubuntu has been installed.


## Dependencies
None, except basic Ubuntu install (tested on Ubuntu 18.04).


## Usage
This can usually be run by calling each .sh script in turn.
But I actually recommend suffering through line-by-line installation.
This allows one to consider the description, and confirm each install.
Also, a few installs require some interaction (e.g. aws).
